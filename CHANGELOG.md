## [Unreleased]
### Added
- URL prefix support to host, e.g., under `http://example.org/gosh/`
- Add goshy as bash script and NixOS program, [@riotbib](https://github.com/riotbib) in [#27](https://github.com/oxzi/gosh/pull/27).
- Created Store RPC working on Unix domain sockets to allow a `fork`+`exec`ed daemon.
- Configuration through YAML configuration file.

### Changed
- Dependency version bumps.
- Great structural refactoring.
- `goshd` became `gosh`.
- Made `gosh` a `chroot`ed, privilege dropped, `fork`+`exec`ed daemon.
- OpenBSD installation changed due to structural program changes.
- Extract web template into a more editable file, [@riotbib](https://github.com/riotbib) in [#45](https://github.com/oxzi/gosh/pull/45).

### Deprecated
### Removed
- The `gosh-query` utility was removed.
- `gosh` lost most of its command line arguments due to the YAML configuration.
- Removed path filtering (Linux' Landlock LSM, OpenBSD's `unveil`) as `gosh` is always `chroot`ed now.

### Fixed
- OpenBSD rc.d file for OpenBSD 7.3 or later.
- Forward web requests to main page if URL is above prefixed root.
